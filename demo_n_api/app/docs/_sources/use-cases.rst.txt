Use cases
============

Training a translation model
----------------------------

The first use-case of our tool, is to train a custom translation model:

#. Gather training datasets
#. Pre-process and create large single file dataset
#. Set the configuration file

Translating terms or files
--------------------------

Given that we have access to a translation model (it may be one of our own trained models or a custom one), a user will be able to translate single or multiple terms via the web application or the API.


Validating translations
-----------------------

A user will be able to suggest improvements or validate the translation of a requested term or sentence. Furthermore, in order to ensure quality of suggested translations and receive constructive feedback, we plan to have groups of users with specific rights of use:

*	Simple user: will be able only to translate single terms or sentences
* Privileged user: will also be able to get translation of files
*	Expert: will also be able to provide feedback on a translation with a rank and suggest a new one

Using the API
-------------

Developers will be able to use the API service for direct translations programmatically.

Our objectives can be summarized in the following points:

* An automated pipeline for translating and evaluating medical terminologies
* Generate ground truth datasets to evaluate our models
* Introduced supervised and unsupervised metrics
* Create online services to provide access to our tools
* Enable researchers and healthcare end-users globally with a jump start approach that allows fast and effective translation of newly updated versions of terminologies
* Beyond translation, the approach can be used to enrich terminologies (e.g. using synonyms) or connect them

Check out the :doc:`installation` section for installing the required packages.
